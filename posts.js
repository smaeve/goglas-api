        "taskDes": "One of the main issues with single-use cotton pads, buds and wipes etc. is that making them is a huge drain on the environment, due to the chemicals, water and deforestation that goes into manufacturing them. Then, once they’re used, they don’t biodegrade because of their plastic content, so impact the environment even further, by contributing to plastic pollution.

        "taskName": "Avoid buying fast fashion",
        "taskDes": "Fast fashion is the rapid production of cheap clothes in high volumes. Low-quality products are pumped out to catch onto short-term trends, ultimately harming the environment and garment workers. Cheaply-made clothes don't last very long, meaning they end up in the landfill. Since many of the clothes are made of synthetic fibres and plastics, they don't biodegrade- meaning they stick around in landfills for up to 200 years. In 2018 alone, 17 million tonnes of textile waste was deposed in landfill. Fabric production requires lots of water, especially cotton, one of the most water-intensive crops. Around 2700 litres are required to produce the equivalent of 1 cotton shirt. Toxic dyes and chemicals used to treat clothes causes around 20% of the world's wastewater. Factories often dump these toxic chemicals into local waterways to reduce costs, causing immense pollution and potentially poising wildlife. The high demand manufacturing and shipping of clothes has a substantial carbon footprint and depletes the low reserves of non-renewable resources.",
